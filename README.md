Same great cookies, now with http cookies as well as fish cookies. You won't know how to react, but you will see sharp increases in quality over the original.

This app makes use of the [Salmon Cookies API](https://github.com/SalmonCookiesAPI/SalmonCookiesAPI) for its data storage. 

## Getting Started

The Pat's Salmon Cookies Admin Dashboard is currently only available running locally. Simply clone the repository and install the dependencies: 

- next.js (`npm i next`) 
- axios (`npm i axios`)

Then, enter the command `npm run dev` to run the site at http://localhost:3000/
